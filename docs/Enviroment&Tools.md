Youâ€™re seeing that error because Kali (Debian-based) protects the system Python from being modified by pip.

## Solving the problem

A Python virtual environment is an isolated copy of a Python interpreter and its packages for a specific project, preventing dependency conflicts between different projects and with the global Python installation. Tools like venv (included in Python 3.3+) allow you to create these environments, which are then activated so you can use their own versions of libraries and modules with pip.

```bash
python3 -m venv 'Your_Virtual_Enviroment_Name'  # Creating the virtual enviroment with the integrated module venv
ls -la | grep -i Your  # Confirming the creation
source ~/'Your_Virtual_Enviroment_Name'/bin/activate  # Activating the virtual enviroment
python3 -m install -r requirements.txt  # Starting the download process

```

```bash
